# ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Direct Company Application Links

## The Reality
After testing, **ALL free job APIs provide aggregator redirect URLs**:
- Jooble: `jooble.org/jdp/...` ‚ùå
- Remotive: `remotive.com/remote-jobs/...` ‚ùå  
- Arbeitnow: `arbeitnow.com/jobs/...` ‚ùå
- RemoteOK: Broken response ‚ùå

**None provide direct company URLs in API responses.**
