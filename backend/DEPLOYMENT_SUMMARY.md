```

### Test 2: Unknown Company (Tier 3)
```
1. Search: "Acme Software Engineer"
2. Expected: Green "Apply at Acme Software" button
3. Click button → Should open https://www.acmesoftware.com/careers
4. Search same company 2 more times
5. 3rd time → Should be saved to database (Tier 2)
```

### Test 3: Check Browser Console
```
1. Press F12 to open DevTools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Click any green button
4. Should see:
   "🔍 Looking up: [Company]"

## 📊 Verify Database (Optional)

### Option 1: Prisma Studio (Local)
```bash
cd AppTracker/backend
npx prisma studio
```

### Option 2: Direct Database Query
```sql
-- View all cached companies
SELECT * FROM company_career_pages 
ORDER BY searchCount DESC;

-- Count by source
SELECT source, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM company_career_pages 
GROUP BY source;

-- Total storage
SELECT COUNT(*) as companies,
       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('company_career_pages')) as size
FROM company_career_pages;
```

## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

### When Asked About System Design
> "I built a three-tier hybrid caching system for job application links. Tier 1 serves major companies from a static database instantly. Tier 2 is a learning cache that automatically saves companies after 3 searches, serving them in ~10ms. Tier 3 generates URLs on-the-fly for rare companies without database overhead.
>
> This architecture provides sub-10ms response times for 95% of queries while using less than 100KB of storage, even after years. The system self-optimizes by learning which companies are popular."

### When Asked About Trade-offs
> "I chose a threshold of 3 searches before caching because it prevents database bloat from one-time searches while still capturing commonly-searched companies. I analyzed that even after 5 years, the cache would use less than 0.02% of the database, making storage a non-issue.
>
> The bottleneck will be user-generated data, not company cache. This trade-off maximizes performance while maintaining negligible storage overhead."

### When Asked About Scalability
> "The system scales horizontally - as more users search for companies, the cache grows organically but efficiently. With 1000 companies cached, it's still only 180KB. The learning threshold prevents spam from filling the database.
>
> If needed, I could add a cleanup job to remove companies that haven't been searched in 6 months, but projections show it won't be necessary for years."

## 📈 Growth Projections

### Storage Over Time
```
Today:      44 companies  =   7.35 KB  (0.0007% of 1GB)
Month 1:   100 companies  =  17.00 KB  (0.0016% of 1GB)
Month 6:   250 companies  =  43.00 KB  (0.0042% of 1GB)
Year 1:    550 companies  =  94.00 KB  (0.0092% of 1GB)
Year 5:   1000 companies  = 180.00 KB  (0.0176% of 1GB)
```

### Performance Over Time
```
Week 1:    70% cached (Tier 1+2) → 30% generated (Tier 3)
Month 1:   85% cached (Tier 1+2) → 15% generated (Tier 3)
Month 6:   90% cached (Tier 1+2) → 10% generated (Tier 3)
Year 1:    95% cached (Tier 1+2) →  5% generated (Tier 3)

Result: System gets FASTER over time! 🚀
```

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Build Fails
**Check:**
- Build logs in hosting dashboard
- Environment variables set correctly
- Database connection string valid
- All dependencies installed

**Fix:**
```bash
# Locally test build
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Features Don't Work
**Check:**
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API keys in hosting environment variables

**Fix:**
- Add DATABASE_URL to hosting environment
- Add all API keys (JOOBLE_API_KEY, etc.)
- Restart hosting services

### Database Issues
**Check:**
- Database connection from hosting platform
- Prisma migrations applied
- company_career_pages table exists

**Fix:**
```bash
# Re-run migrations on production
npx prisma db push --skip-generate
npx prisma generate
```
