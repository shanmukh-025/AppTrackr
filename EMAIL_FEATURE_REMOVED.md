## What Remains:

### Database:
- Email-related fields still exist in User model (emailNotifications, dailyDigest, etc.)
- These fields are not used but won't cause issues
- Can be removed in future database migration if needed

### Backend Code (Not Deleted):
- `/services/emailService.js` - Service file remains but is not loaded
- `/routes/notifications.js` - Notification routes remain but email endpoints not called
- Email-related Prisma models remain in schema

**Reason:** These files are kept in case you want to re-enable email feature in the future. They don't affect the app since they're not imported/used.

## To Re-enable Email Feature:

If you want to add email back in the future:

1. **Uncomment in server.js:**
   ```javascript
   const emailService = require('./services/emailService');
   emailService.initializeTransporter();
   emailService.scheduleDailyDigest();
   emailService.scheduleDeadlineReminders();
   ```

2. **Add Resend API key to .env:**
   ```env
   RESEND_API_KEY=your-api-key
   EMAIL_FROM="AppTrackr <onboarding@resend.dev>"
   ```

3. **Restore EmailSettings page:**
   - Files are deleted, would need to recreate

4. **Add back to Sidebar and App.js**

5. **Buy and verify custom domain** for all users to receive emails

## Current App Status:

✅ **Working Features:**

## Next Steps:
