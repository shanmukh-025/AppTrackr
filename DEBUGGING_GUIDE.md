# 🧪 DEBUGGING GUIDE: Career Page Links

## Current Setup
- Backend: Updated to prioritize career pages ✅
- Frontend: Green buttons for major companies ✅
- Database: 50+ companies with career pages ✅

## How to Test

### 1. **Open Browser Console**
Press **F12** → Click "Console" tab

### 2. **Refresh the Page**
Go to: http://localhost:3000
Login if needed

### 3. **Look at Job Cards**

**For Major Companies (Google, Microsoft, etc.):**
```
You should see:
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Google                             │
│ Software Engineer                  │
│                                    │
│ [✅ Apply at Google →] (GREEN)    │
│                                    │
│ ℹ️ Or view full job listing:      │
│ 📋 View on Jooble → (gray button) │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**For Unknown Companies:**
```
You should see:
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Unknown Startup Inc                │
│ Software Engineer                  │
│                                    │
│ [View Job Details →] (BLUE)       │
│                                    │
│ (No secondary links)               │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. **Click the GREEN Button**

When you click "✅ Apply at Google →":

**In Console, you should see:**
```
🟢 GREEN BUTTON CLICKED!
  Opening career page: https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/
```

**In Browser:**
- New tab should open
- URL should be: `careers.google.com/jobs/results/`
- **NOT**: `google.com/search...`
- **NOT**: `jooble.org/...`

### 5. **If You Still See Google Search**

Check these things:

**A. Which button did you click?**
- ✅ Green "Apply at {Company}" → Should go to career page
- 📋 Gray "View on Jooble" → Should go to job listing (expected)

**B. What does the console say?**
- If no "🟢 GREEN BUTTON CLICKED" → Frontend not updated
- If shows different URL → Check what URL is displayed

**C. What company is it?**
- Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon → Should have career page
- Unknown startup → Will show blue button (expected)

### 6. **Backend Logging**

The backend logs what it's sending. Look for:
```
📋 Sample job being sent to frontend:
  Company: Google
  Career Page: https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/
  URL: https://jooble.org/jdp/...
  Direct URL: null
```

If `Career Page: null` → Company not in database

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Still shows Google search"

**Possible causes:**

1. **Frontend not refreshed**
   - Solution: Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
   - Clear cache if needed

2. **Clicking wrong button**
   - Green button → Career page ✅
   - Gray button → Job listing (aggregator)

3. **Company not in database**
   - Solution: Check if company is in career pages database
   - Run: `node testCareerPages.js`

4. **Old code cached**
   - Solution: Restart frontend
   - `cd frontend` → `npm start`

### Issue: "No green buttons appear"

**Possible causes:**

1. **No major companies in results**
   - Expected! Not all jobs are from major companies
   - Try searching "Software Engineer Remote"

2. **Career pages returning null**
   - Test: `node testCareerPages.js`
   - Should show URLs for Google, Microsoft, etc.

3. **Backend not updated**
   - Check server is running: http://localhost:5000
   - Restart: `cd backend` → `npm run dev`

### Issue: "Green button goes to aggregator"

**This means:**
- Career page field has aggregator URL somehow
- Check backend logs for what it's sending

## Expected Behavior Summary

### ✅ CORRECT:
- Google job → Green "Apply at Google" → Opens careers.google.com
- Microsoft job → Green "Apply at Microsoft" → Opens careers.microsoft.com
- Unknown company → Blue "View Job Details" → Opens aggregator

### ❌ WRONG:
- Any job → Google search page
- Green button → Aggregator site
- Career page → Google.com/search?q=...

## Quick Test Script

Run this in backend folder to verify career pages work:
```bash
cd backend
node testCareerPages.js
```

Should show:
```
Google: https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/ ✅
Microsoft: https://careers.microsoft.com/... ✅
Unknown Startup: null ✅
```
