# 🔧 AI Features - Critical Fixes Applied!

## ✅ **Critical Bug Fixed!**

### **The Problem:**
Error message: `"Failed to generate cover letter: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')"`

### **Root Cause:**
- ❌ Backend routes were using `req.user.id`
- ✅ Auth middleware actually sets `req.userId`
- Result: `userId` was undefined, causing database operations to fail

### **Solution Applied:**
Changed ALL 6 AI endpoints from `req.user.id` to `req.userId`:

1. ✅ `POST /api/ai/analyze-resume` - Line 15
2. ✅ `GET /api/ai/resume-analyses` - Line 75
3. ✅ `POST /api/ai/generate-cover-letter` - Line 106
4. ✅ `GET /api/ai/cover-letters` - Line 174
5. ✅ `DELETE /api/ai/cover-letters/:id` - Line 194
6. ✅ `POST /api/ai/generate-interview-prep` - Line 219
7. ✅ `GET /api/ai/interview-preps` - Line 265
8. ✅ `PATCH /api/ai/interview-preps/:id` - Line 296

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - All AI features should now work!
