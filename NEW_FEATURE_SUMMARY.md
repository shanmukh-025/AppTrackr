|----------|-----------|
| **LinkedIn** | Shows jobs, says "You may be a good fit" (generic keyword matching) |
| **Indeed** | Basic keyword search, no personalization |
| **Glassdoor** | Company reviews, no individual fit analysis |
| **ZipRecruiter** | Job aggregation, simple matching |
| **Hired/Vettery** | Curated applications but no prediction |
| **AppTrackr** | **AI-powered hiring probability with actionable roadmap** ✅ |
